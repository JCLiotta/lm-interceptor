# lm-interceptor
This was a fun project I did when I was working at Lockheed Martin. It was for Young Minds At Work Day. Basically, it's a Python script that uses OpenCV to track a yellow ball. Then using I2C, tells an Arduino which wheels to turn to follow the ball, a very primitive interceptor. It was trying to illustrate what missile defense does to the kids that attended the Young Minds At Work Day (bring your kids to work day).
