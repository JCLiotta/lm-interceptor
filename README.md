# lm-interceptor
This was a fun project I did when I was working at Lockheed Martin. It was for Young Minds At Work Day. Basically, it's a Python script that uses OpenCV to track a yellow ball. Then using I2C tells an Arduino which wheels to turn to follow the ball. A very primitive interceptor. It was trying to illustrate what missile defense does to the kids.
